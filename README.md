### How the game works
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

The following text is displayed on the user page:
- Guess what letter I'm thinking of
- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
</br>
- When the player wins, the Wins counter is increased and the game starts over again without refreshing the page.</br>
- When the player loses, the Losses counter is increased and the game restarts without a page refresh.
